## Overview

The Actions System is the main tool used by operations and customer service teams at [Skip](https://www.skipthedishes.com), one of the biggest food delivery apps in Canada. The system was created with the goal of helping Skip's internal teams to manage and organize recurrent tasks and solve possible problems that happen every day across the entire order flow  that directly impact the quality of the service provided to all Skip's customers (final customers, restaurants and couriers).

### **Key Features**  
- **Automated Action Queue**: Actions were automatically assigned to users based on pre-defined priorities, reducing manual work.  
- **Contextual Information Display**: Users could see relevant details about an action without navigating multiple pages.  
- **Assignment Management for Team Leads**: A dedicated page allowed Team Leads to manage priorities and preferences manually.  
- **Improved UI and UX**: A modernized interface made the system more intuitive and efficient.  
- **MVP Approach for Scalability**: The system was designed with flexibility in mind, allowing for future enhancements.

### **Challenges & Learnings**  
- **Tech Limitations & Scope Reduction**: The original vision had to be scaled down due to tech constraints, leading to an MVP approach.  
- **User Training & Complexity**: Initial research revealed that onboarding was inefficient due to the systemâ€™s complexity.  
- **Need for Automation**: Manual assignment of actions led to inefficiencies and human errors.  
- **Business & User Alignment**: Increasing efficiency was a business goal, but improving UX naturally contributed to this goal.  
- **Iterative Process & Adaptability**: Feedback loops with users helped refine the system and address missing details.
