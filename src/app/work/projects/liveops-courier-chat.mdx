## **LiveOps Courier Chat**  

### **Overview**  
The LiveOps Courier Chat was a project developed during my time at SkipTheDishesâ€™ LiveOps Team. The goal was to rebuild the internal courier chat experience to improve efficiency for operations agents and ensure couriers received faster, more effective support. The previous system had poor UX, requiring manual chat selection, which led to long wait times and an inefficient workflow for ops users. The redesigned experience introduced automation, contextual data, and multi-chat management, enhancing both agent productivity and courier support speed.  

### **Key Features**  
- **Automated Priority Queue**: Urgent chats were automatically queued first, reducing wait times.  
- **Multi-Chat Management**: Enabled ops users to handle multiple conversations efficiently without losing context.  
- **Contextual Information Display**: Relevant courier and order details were accessible within the chat, minimizing the need for page navigation.  
- **Tag System for Quick Insights**: Chats were categorized with tags, allowing ops users to quickly understand the topic before engaging.  

### **Challenges & Learnings**  
- **Manual Chat Selection Was Inefficient**: The old system forced agents to pick chats manually, leading to delays. Automating the queue significantly improved response times.  
- **Multi-Tasking Was Essential**: Ops users frequently handled multiple chats simultaneously, so enabling seamless chat switching was critical.  
- **Information Fragmentation Slowed Down Agents**: Agents had to navigate multiple pages for courier details. Consolidating relevant data within the chat streamlined workflows.  
- **Balancing Efficiency with User Experience**: While increasing operational efficiency was a priority, improving UX for ops users naturally contributed to better outcomes.  

### **Outcome**  
- **Faster Support Response**: Couriers received help more quickly due to automated prioritization.  
- **Increased Ops Team Efficiency**: Multi-chat handling and contextual data reduced the time spent per chat.  
- **Higher User Satisfaction**: Ops agents found the system more intuitive, leading to improved overall workflow and morale.  

The new LiveOps Courier Chat successfully optimized the support process, making it faster and more efficient for both agents and couriers. ðŸš€
