## **Spud Checkout**  
### **Improving the Checkout Experience for SPUDâ€™s E-Commerce Website**  

## Project Overview

**SPUD** (Sustainable Produce Urban Delivery) is a Canadian grocery delivery service that specializes in locally sourced, organic, and sustainable products. Operating in British Columbia and Alberta, SPUD provides eco-friendly deliveries with a focus on reducing waste and supporting local producers.

As the **Lead Product Designer**, part of my responsibilities were to identify usability issues across the website and improve the overall user experience to attract more customers and boost sales. One of the main challenges uncovered was a **high cart abandonment rate**, which signaled a problematic checkout experience, especially for first-time users.

This case study focuses on **Phase 1** of our work: redesigning the checkout flow to reduce friction, increase clarity, and improve conversions.

## Team Setup

- Head of Product & Design  
- Product Manager  
- Data Specialist  
- Lead Product Designer *(me)*  ðŸ‘‹
- Tech team: 2 in-house developers + 4 contractors

## The Problem

Through analytics and internal research, we identified the checkout process as a major friction point in the customer journey. Key issues included:

- High cart abandonment rates, especially among new users  
- Customer feedback citing a confusing or inefficient checkout experience  
- Lack of basic UX principles in the existing flow (e.g., clarity, simplicity, efficiency)  

We also aimed to introduce **guest checkout** (coming soon in a new case study), but at the time, foundational UX improvements were necessary before introducing new features.

## Goals

- Simplify and optimize the checkout flow  
- Minimize friction and reduce drop-offs  
- Improve conversion, especially for new users  
- Lay the foundation for future enhancements like guest checkout  

---

## Design Process

### 1. Discovery

- Conducted a website UX audit, focusing on checkout  
- Collaborated with our Data Specialist to analyze customer behavior  
- Leveraged existing customer research from the Marketing team  
- Performed competitive analysis to benchmark against industry best practices  
- Held a kickoff session to align team expectations, timeline, and goals  

### 2. Definition

- Consolidated insights from analytics, customer feedback, and UX review  
- Created a problem statement and outlined key friction points  
- Documented findings and design opportunities for the team  

### 3. Ideation

- Designed user flows and low-fidelity wireframes  
- Ran collaborative workshops with the Product Manager, Data Specialist, and Developers  
- Recognizing the value of multiple viewpoints, I prioritized cross-functional feedback to complement my solo designer role and avoid working in a silo  

### 4. Design

- Created high-fidelity prototypes for web and mobile using Figma  
- Despite a limited testing budget, I conducted informal usability testing with internal SPUD employees who were also customers  
- Ensured the redesign felt familiar to long-time users, maintaining trust and consistency  

### 5. Delivery

- Delivered final designs in Figma using Dev Mode for a clear handoff  
- Partnered with the Product Manager to create design tickets and design specs  
- Supported the development team by reviewing implementation and troubleshooting design issues during the build  

### 6. Iteration & Launch

- Soft-launched the new checkout flow to a limited audience in Alberta to test and gather feedback  
- Addressed technical bugs and made small improvements before rolling out site-wide

## Challenges

**Technical constraints:**  
The legacy codebase made changes difficult and time-consuming.

**Team resistance:**  
The dev team, which had originally built the site, was hesitant about implementing changes.

**Solutions:**  
- Advocated for design changes using data-driven insights  
- Maintained open communication, patience, and kindness  
- Gained buy-in with support from leadership and by showing progress in small, incremental steps  

---

## Results

- Checkout conversion rate improved by **approximately 18%**  
- Internal and external feedback was consistently positive, highlighting improved clarity and ease of use  
- Laid the groundwork for future enhancements, including guest checkout
