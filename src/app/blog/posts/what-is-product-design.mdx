## Introduction
Seniority isn’t just about years of experience — it’s about the depth of understanding and the perspectives you gain along the way. However, with over 15 years of designing interfaces and crafting user experiences, I can say I’ve had plenty of time to uncover the many wonders (and challenges) of being a product designer in tech.

In this article, I’ll break down the basics of why product design still matters, as well as share some personal insights from my own journey working in tech.

## But wait, what is product design?
Product design is the process of creating, envisioning, and refining usable products and experiences. It starts with identifying and defining real people’s problems. It’s a balanced blend of creativity, functionality, and usability, with the end goal of creating solutions that are both practical and functional while also appealing to users.

> 💭 Design is often mistaken as being only about aesthetics, but at its core, it’s about solving problems for end users while aligning with business objectives. Aesthetics are just one aspect, serving to enhance competitiveness and effectively communicate the brand.

### Here are some key elements of product design:

### Problem Solving
At its heart, product design is about identifying and solving user problems. This is perhaps the most crucial skill a designer must master. Designers prioritize understanding users’ needs and challenges to create products that address those problems effectively.

### User-Centered Approach
While product design also involves balancing business goals and technical constraints, understanding the target audience’s needs, preferences, and behaviors is essential. This ensures the creation of products that are intuitive, functional, and enjoyable to use.

### The Role of Aesthetic Appeal
Aesthetics play an important role in aligning products with brand values and fostering emotional connections with users. However, aesthetic choices should never compromise functionality or usability.

### Functionality and Usability
A successful product must work as intended, meet user expectations, and deliver a seamless experience. Ensuring functionality and usability is a critical part of the product design process.

### Iterative Development
Product design is inherently iterative. It involves prototyping, testing, and refining ideas based on user feedback and market standards to achieve the best possible outcome for users.

### Collaboration
While user needs are central, business requirements and technical constraints often influence product design. Collaboration with stakeholders, including business leaders and developers, is essential to create viable and impactful products in practice.

## The Five Planes
One of my favorite materials to quickly explain designing digital products is *The Five Planes of User Experience* framework by Jesse James Garrett. It provides a structured approach that starts from high-level goals (*Strategy*) all the way to the visual design (*Surface*).

### A quick overview of each level:
- **Strategy Plane**: Define user needs and make sure they align with business/project goals.
- **Scope Plane**: Outline needed features and content requirements.
- **Structure Plane**: Organize interactions and build information/user flows.
- **Skeleton Plane**: Design wireframes and plan out layouts and navigation elements.
- **Surface Plane**: Finalize by creating the visuals and high-fidelity designs.

## Where Do “Problems to Solve” Come From?
Before diving into the design process, its fundamental stages, and how we approach problems, let’s start with the backlog: where all those problems originate.

A backlog is a prioritized list of all the work that needs to be completed. Here are a few common ways problems or tasks make their way onto the backlog:

- **Stakeholder Input**: Ideas and requirements from across the organization, including designers, product managers, and engineers.
- **User Feedback**: Insights from surveys, support tickets, user research, and feature requests.
- **Strategic Initiatives**: Projects aligning with high-level company goals.
- **Analytics and Data Insights**: Observing metrics, market trends, and competitor behavior.
- **Technical Debt and Maintenance**: Engineering-led tasks for system upgrades and fixes.
- **Innovation and Experimentation**: New ideas or experiments proposed by teams.
- **Compliance and Regulation**: Legal or industry requirements driving accessibility and regulation adherence.

## The Product Design Process: From Concept to Iteration
The product design process is a structured approach to conceptualizing, creating, and refining products that meet both user needs and business goals.

### 1. Research & Discovery: Be Curious and Ask Questions
The goal is to identify the problem, understand the target audience, and explore market and business needs.

### 2. Define: Organize and Strategize
Set objectives and craft a concise problem statement to guide the design process.

### 3. Ideate: Brainstorm and Sketch
Explore potential solutions through brainstorming sessions and low-fidelity wireframes or sketches.

### 4. Prototype: Build the Solution
Create low or high-fidelity prototypes to visualize and test solutions quickly.

### 5. Test: Validate with Users
Conduct usability tests, A/B testing, or user interviews to gather insights and refine designs.

### 6. Finalize and Implement: Bring It to Life
Prepare final designs for development, ensuring pixel-perfect execution and alignment with developers.

### 7. Iterate (Post-Launch): Continuous Improvement
Monitor user behavior, gather feedback, and refine the product based on insights.

## Beyond the Basics…
If you’ve spent any significant time in Product Design, you know that the day-to-day reality can be quite different from the ideal scenarios often portrayed. Here are some personal insights and tips:

### 🦎 Stay Adaptable
Change is constant. Being ready to adapt quickly — and even driving some of those changes — is key.

### 🧐 Be Curious, Not Judgmental (Especially with New Tools and Tech)
Stay open to learning new tools and methodologies as technology evolves.

### 🤝 Team Work Makes the Dream Work
Avoid working in silos. Collaborate closely with stakeholders, especially product managers and developers.

### 📢 Be the Voice of Design (Amid Chaos)
Advocate for UX considerations, even when constraints like time and resources are tight.

> **Important:** Ensure that all communication is conducted formally (email or group channels) and shared across the team for transparency and accountability.

## Conclusion
Working in design in this era has undoubtedly been challenging, but creating products that genuinely solve problems for real people remains incredibly important. While the future of product design and UX is uncertain, staying observant, open to change, and adaptable to new realities will always be essential. Let’s embrace the journey, taking it one day at a time, and enjoying the process while we can. 🚀
